# Mocha_Debrief
  
  
You should write Macha code that will test the functionalities of add() and fizzBuzz() functions.  
Don't forget to initialize npm, instal Mocha, and change the scripts in the package.json to run the test suite <command npm> test.  
Try to use TDD - test code, implement code, refactor the code.  
  

Create a function called add() that returns the sum of two given numbers  
Using TDD write ensure your function can do the following:  
    1. add two arguments  
    2. handles only one argument  
    3. handles 0 as arguments  
    4. returns 0 if any of the arguments in not a number  
  
  
  
Write a program that prints the numbers.  
    1. numbers multiples of three prints “Fizz” instead of the number  
    2. numbers multiples of five prints “Buzz” instead of the number.  
    3. numbers which are multiples of three and five prints “FizzBuzz”  
    4.  and numbers that are either multiple of three or five prints the number.  
    Ex: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, ...
